High praise for the accessibility of each scenario, it isn’t overly difficult to the point beginners would practice incorrectly and it’s not too easy so there is still value for adept aimers to practice. However, the ordering of the scenarios is suboptimal, especially towards the latter half of the warmup."

The extensive amount of static practice causes an extremely high amount of overlap of the mechanics between each scenario being practiced which makes the playlist very inefficient compared to a well-balanced playlist that covers multiple types of aiming."

There is a heavy lean into target switching at the sacrifice of dynamic clicking to create an optimal playlist length of 11 mins. The lack of good dynamic clicking scenarios will make this personalised playlist extremely problematic for the average player using this to warm up."
