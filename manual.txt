This is just to note down how the general structure of nextjs works
-> App is the home directory
-> Any folders made in the directory indicate a new route being made
-> If you want to dynamically route -> [slug]/profile or smth

-> nextjs will route based on url, so if url is xxx/slug/profile -> will route to [slug]/profile

Link -> href = [variable]/profile -> links to the page. no need to pass anything in
